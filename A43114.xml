         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>JOHN CROOKE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY firſt coming to <hi>Hartford</hi> was ſoon after ſome ſharp and long Buffetings that I had been exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, (as my Chriſtian Friends know.) The Lord was but then rebuking Satan, taking the Lyon off me, and delivering me, and reſtoring Comfort to me, there did remain many impreſſions of thoſe Buffetings upon my Spirit, which the Lord in rich Mercy hath ſince healed, and taken away the ſmart and pain, by giving me Faith in the Blood of ſprinkling; much Guilt and Filth was left upon my Conſcience contracted by that long Combate, Satan finding ſo much in me to work upon; but there hath been a waſhing, and pardoning, and reconciling and Sanctifying ſince that time.</p>
            <p>Coming to <hi>Hartford,</hi> I found many of the People called Quakers, Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting there, was glad in this reſpect that I might thereby have occaſion to try their Spirit, Way, and Doctrine farther, which at <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, I had been frequently ſearching into. Hereupon I refuſed no Converſe or Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety with them, and my behaviour towards them, was with Love and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; inſomuch that I have in my publick Preaching given offence to ſome of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r bearers, in that what was commendable in the Quakers practice, I have
<pb facs="tcp:52451:3"/>reckoned up and praiſed, at ſuch times as I have Preached Truths againſt their Opinions. My carriage was ſuch towards you that it was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported that I was not far from you, that I was coming to you. I was very willing to entertain diſcourſe with any of you, and with thee, when it was deſired by ſome, which was effected, &amp; it appears thou haſt not forgotten it, in that thou mentioneſt it in this Epiſtle, that it was in ſome freedom from Heat and Paſſion: That Meeting was beneficial to us by reaſon of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from thee at that time, <hi>viz.</hi> That the New Creature was an higher thing than the Light within, and that you did but point out people to the Light, in order to the New Creature. Remember this, <hi>John,</hi> of which there are many Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Within two days I had another diſcourſe with thee in the Town, and I dare appeal to all the Light thou haſt in thy Conſcience, if there were not much extravagant Heat that day in thy ſelf and Friends. Thou may'ſt <hi>John</hi> to this day hear it that ſome of thy own party ſaid; that <hi>John Crooke</hi> was not in a right Spirit that day: Pray forget not <hi>John,</hi> what a good and wholeſome Truth thou oppoſedſt that day: <hi>viz.</hi> the everlaſtingneſs of the Covenant of Grace, ſaying, that <hi>David was out of Covenant when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Temptation;</hi> This thou knoweſt <hi>Arminius</hi> is for, and all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, <hi>viz. a Total falling from Grace.</hi> In that diſpute I dare not ſay I had no itch after applauſe or vain Glory ſtirring in me, nor any anger, but I can ſay through Grace my main deſign was for the defence of the Truth, for the prevention of errours. Not long after this, God's providence ordered a Priſon for me, where there were many of thy Brethren, forty or fifty, ſome of them were Teachers, and had been for ſome conſiderable time. Here I had a fair opportunity of making inquiry and informing my ſelf, whether the things I had heard reported of this people were true as to their Opinions, &amp; whether I had ſuch cauſe to be ſo jealous of them as I was, having diſcourſed them before, the Lord keeping up this Principle ſtill in me, that I would follow Truth in whomſoever I found it. Here many days did I engage in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates with them touching many great things in Religion: <hi>viz.</hi> Touching Original Sin: againſt this, that any ſuch thing was upon Children when they come into the World, they did contend, <hi>viz. Chriſtopher Taylor, Lewis Lacondy</hi> with others of them: The laſt named, aſſerted, that a Child when born is as innocent as <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe was before he ſinned: <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor</hi> diſputed very much againſt the Reſurrection of the Body with me. This ſame <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> called the Doctrine of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Deviliſh damnable and Blaſphemous Doctrine. How often did I be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this Man repeat this in his Preachings, <hi>do this and Live,</hi> which is the voit of the Law in oppoſition to the Goſpel, <hi>Rom. 10. Thomas Bur</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:52451:3"/>
               <hi>Ware,</hi> did at that time acknowledge in my Chamber, that be apprehended nothing in the point of Juſtification that we talked of. Theſe are Teachers in your <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And how many times have I heard this Man run in his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the people, into moſt ſtrange, uncouth, dark, unintelligible non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical Allegories upon the Scriptures! The Lord lay not this to ſome of your Charge, that are greatly guilty of a dreadful abuſe of the Holy Scripture this way: and you do ſtill up and down the Countries confound the poor people, that muſt ſtand and wonder at that which neither they nor the Teachers themſelves underſtand. <hi>Thomas Moſs</hi> of <hi>Balwick</hi> did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue this with me ſo long that I durſt talk no longer, leſt I ſhould have been an occaſion of his Blaſpheming, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt could not be born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> in caſe ſhe was a Sinner, without ſin.</p>
            <p>Thus was I trained up with them eleven Months, heard their Prayers made many a time, and was glad to hear them in the ſeeming fervency and Zeal; but theſe Prayers were not to me, like the Prayers of the Holy Men of God, <hi>Ezra, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. Not with Confeſſions, neither did I ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear ſuch an expreſſion as this which <hi>Daniel</hi> bad, viz. <hi>For the Lord's ſake.</hi> I could not diſcern that any uſe of Faith was made of Jeſus as a Mediator now without, while the Spirit did ſeem to ſtir up ſighs within. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand withal this to be one of the firſt-born of your errours (which <hi>Thomas Bur</hi> would not deny,) <hi>viz.</hi> that every one of your Teachers is equal to the Prophets and Apoſtles, and ſo their writings equal with the Scripture: I told <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor</hi> what <hi>William Penn</hi> ſaid to a friend of mine, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>George Fox</hi> was as good a Prophet as <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and he did affirm it likewiſe. I can truly ſay, ſo much ignorance and confidence did I find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt this people there, and ſo much errour and darkneſs, and withal ſo much of a worldly Spirit in their Converſe together, that had I had ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inclinations to them than thou thinkeſt I had, I ſhould have been alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and at a greater diſtance from them: my ſoul was grieved many a time, by hearing what I did; and I call the Lord to witneſs, that I wrong them not, but ſpeak the Truth. Since this <hi>J. Bolton</hi> made a diſturbance in our Meeting, and diſcourſing with him in the hearing of many, he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned my attributing an humane Nature to Chriſt, be there would grant Chriſt to appear in a Body, and that was all, he would not anſwer to me, asking him whether that Body of his (taking hold of his hand) roſe again. Lately from <hi>Green,</hi> a Teacher among you, I could have no anſwer, where be believed the Man Chriſt was, More lately in diſcourſe with ſome, That it was the Light within that was Crucified without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> That the Mediator was in Heaven, but that Heaven was any where out of him: where the Mediator was, I could not get him to Anſwer: this was <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb facs="tcp:52451:4"/>Prior</hi> of <hi>Stanſtead,</hi> and his Wife would not tell me whether ſhe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped Chriſt within, or Chriſt without. I call to mind the Original of this people in the North, I have been told by ſome that have ſeen them, that they were extraordinarily acted by a Spirit, being ſome of them thrown down upon the ground in foamings and tremblings; and then would ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a ſtrange way. I have been told by one that was in the Room at <hi>Cambridge</hi> at the firſt Riſe of them, how in a Chamber where he was, every thing in the Room, Table, Bedſtead, Stools, &amp;c. and every perſon there (being many) trembled and ſhook, himſelf excepted. I my ſelf did ſee <hi>Ann Blackling</hi> acted more than ordinarlily, who now is no Quaker (as I ſuppoſe thou knoweſt). Now be not angry if for my own ſouls ſake, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether this Spirit be the ſame Spirit wherewith all the Holy Men of God were acted, the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt the ſon, that is in all Chriſt's people, and how ſhould I know but by examining the fruits of it. I can never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>James Naylor,</hi> whom I ſaw ſuffer, and what was the fruit of that Spirit by which he was acted; was he not ſtrangely lifted up in Pride, to make himſelf the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and take divine worſhip to himſelf? <hi>John Bolton</hi> told me that he ſtood by and ſaw three Women one after another fall down and worſhip him, and one of them in her Bowings, had theſe words, <hi>viz. thy Name is no more James, but, I am.</hi> And <hi>James Naylor</hi> told <hi>John Bolton,</hi> that if he worſhipped his Body, he ſhould refuſe it, but if that within, he would accept it: now by what Spirit was this Man acted? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I have called to mind all thoſe extravagant things that ſome of you have been put upon, contrary to all the Light of Reaſon and Nature, beyond all the bounds of Civility and Modeſty, <hi>viz.</hi> the beſmearing your naked Bodies with Dung, and in that manner going naked into the Chriſtian Aſſemblies; how ſome of you have been put upon Voiages beyond Sea to Preach (as I have heard) and yet have been cut off by Death, before you have come there. But it is more than all this to me, that this Spirit hath carried you forth moſt eſpecially in Reviling and oppoſing the beſt people in the World, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Nation, and the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, and what Truth is there that you in your Writings and Preachings have not oppoſed at times, of which our Brethren have given a late faithful account out of your own Brethrens Writings. Now <hi>John,</hi> blame me not if I have been wary and watchful, leaſt I ſhould be poſſeſſed by a Spirit that leads to ſuch things as theſe; there is nothing more plain to me than this, that immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the entrance into your way there is in your Proſelytes not ſuch an attending to vocal Prayer as before, nor ſuch a diligent ſearch of the Holy Scriptures, nor ſuch high thoughts of the perſon of Jeſus, and mighty ſlighting thought of his Goſpel-Inſtitutions, <hi>viz.</hi> the Supper of the Lord, &amp;c.

And whereas thou ſpeakeſt of flying, I have fled for refuge to the Hope ſet before me, and that Spirit of burning that was in me, hath conſumed in ſome meaſure thoſe proud Phariſaical, ſelf conceited thoughts that I had of my own Righteouſneſs.

I know your care for your Proſelytes this way hath been very much: And whereas thou ſayeſt, that I once ſpake ſo reſpectfully of the Light and Spirit within. I do ſo ſtill both publickly and privately, and God forbid I ſhould be an oppoſer of it, or an Enemy to it: Let my Tongue firſt cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, let me firſt be dumb, and never ſpeak any more: but the Lord hath learned me to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of things, not to confound them as thou doſt, which ſhall be more plainly ſhewn thee in the Anſwer which follows. I Believe and ſpeak, that Light which every Child of wrath hath as he cometh into this world, is not the Spirit as he is ſpoke of in the New Teſtament, the Spirit of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Adoption, the Spirit of the Son; nay, whatever thou wilt call it, it is
<pb facs="tcp:52451:5"/>but Fleſh, <hi>whatſoever is born of the Fleſh (i.e.)</hi> what ever Man is in his firſt-Birth, he is but Fleſh, <hi>John 3.</hi> and in the <hi>1 Pet. 1. All Fleſh is Graſs,</hi> all called Fleſh till the New-Birth of the incorruptible Seed which every Man hath not; yet I have given and will give this Light its due, and ſay it is from Chriſt, he is the Author of it, that gave Man his Rational Soul, and created all Lights, and had not the Lord preſerved this Light, Mankind had not been, the <hi>Species</hi> would have been extinct, and we like bruits, and hereby is Man made fit for humane Society and Common-Wealths; and through the reſtraining-Grace of God joined with this (for I attribute it to that indeed chiefly, as in the caſe of <hi>Abimelech, Gen. 20. I kept thee, &amp;c.</hi> elſe the Light within would not have done it) Man is preſerved from many groſs outward evils. One can diſtinguiſh between many things that are good and evil, by this Light, but to ſay as thou and others do, that it is the Spirit, Chriſt, Regenerating Grace, God, as thou doſt in thy words in this Epiſtle (as I underſtand it), let others judg of it) calleth it the Son of God, King of <hi>Zion,</hi> applying that of the ſecond <hi>Pſalm</hi> to this Light, therefore it is the Rule, the Life, the Blood, the Principle, ſuch horrid Blaſphemies as theſe, dethroning Chriſt's perſon, turning the God-Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reaſon, Conſcience or Soul of Man, making them all one, and God, the Spirit the ſame with this which is in every Murtherer, Robber, was in them, <hi>Job. 21.</hi> goes with the damned to Hell, remains with them there, <hi>Hear ye Heavens, and give ear O Earth,</hi> and be horribly aſhamed of ſuch Tenents as theſe! my Soul through the Grace of God utterly abhors and deteſts them, and I am and will be a profeſſed Enemy to them as long as I have being in this world, and doubts not in the leaſt but Chriſt will ſtand by me in this his cauſe. Oh how doth this puff up poor proud fallen Man that there is ſomething left in him yet that will reſtore him, when all the Light he had before, could not preſerve him from falling: This thou haſt heard at leaſt was the old rotten gangrene of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> pleading for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. O ceaſe <hi>John,</hi> ceaſe perverting the right ways of God, pleading for Nature in oppoſition to the Grace of God. As for the Bands which thou mentioneſt of Chriſt the Son, ſpoken of in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm.</hi> and for his cords, they are welcome to me, I embrace them, and it is my Liberty to be his Captive and Priſoner. It's freedom from my luſts, I have found it ſo, and do. But no falſe Prophets (as thou and others, while you maintain theſe Doctrines) ſhall ever bring me into bondage again, to the curſing Law and the works of it, looking for Life that way. Yet do I wholly ſtoop to this King of <hi>Zion,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, as my Lord, as he that hath ſubdued all my Enemies virtually already, and will actually in time, which I wait for, and hath given out Rules how he will be ſerved and worſhipped, which according to
<pb facs="tcp:52451:5"/>my Light I deſire to be found in, deſiring this glorious King by the power of his Spirit to ſubdue all evil in my Soul. But let me entreat thee, <hi>John,</hi> to uſe plain words when thou ſpeakeſt of the works of God in the heart of Man by the Spirit, at leaſt ſay no more than what is ſaid of it in the Holy Scriptures, and do not uſe to ſtrain Scripture and wreſt it from its proper literal meaning when there is no need ſo to do but the doing of it takes off from the Glory of it and the Authority of the Truth contained in it. Here thou turneſt that great Scripture in <hi>Zachary</hi> into an Allegory, which is a Prophecy of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> coming for the comfort of his people, and was fulfilled in the Letter which was very glorious, and beſpake him to be the true Meſſias, the ground of all Comfort to his people; and he came in this low and mean way to ſhew his contempt of the World, who could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Glory of the Creation, to attend him in this Triumph and State, and yet this he did to ſhew forth ſomething of his Authority and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, being really a King. Now, <hi>John,</hi> why wilt thou go this way to work to uſe theſe uncouth Allegories, is it not for want of plain and ſubſtantial knowledge in the Scriptures? Doſt thou not know what miſchief this way of ſpeaking hath done? The evil one hath made uſe of this way in the World in falſe Teachers, to take off from the Authority of the Scriptures. I pray God this be not your intent in going this way: if many ſenſes of the Scripture, then no one ſence is certain, for I have heard thee my ſelf ſay this, <hi>viz. He brought his Son out of</hi> Egypt, i.e. <hi>out of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an darkneſs of our hearts.</hi> Why doth not this take off from the Hiſtory, as if that were nothing, as if ſuch a thing had never been, the Man Chriſt brought from that Country ſo called really and truely: but as if this was the great intendment of the Holy-Ghoſt in it, as to the work of God upon Mans heart: now this was groſs, thick darkneſs, ſuch as might be felt; why then ſurely there is no Light before Chriſt be brought forth; and yet you call the Light Chriſt: <hi>John,</hi> it ſavours not right, to ſay God brought his Son out of Egyptian darkneſs. That work of the Spirit in our hearts is not God's Son, and to ſay God's Son is brought out of darkneſs, Egyptian darkneſs, who was with God from Eternity, and was God, and was Light, the Light of the world as Mediator, and ſo the Author of all ſaving Light, it is abſurd. But this is not ſo bad, as that which thou ſpakeſt in <hi>Sarah Whites</hi> Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> in my hearing and the hearing of others of my friends, <hi>viz.</hi> the only begotten Son, begotten in us. Now <hi>John,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou chargeſt me with Blaſphemy which ſhall be examined, who now is guilty? thou bluſheſt ſurely to think on it, you often ſpeak of my tenderneſs how hard are your hearts, that you can hear and ſpeak ſuch things as theſe and no ſhame upon you, whereas at that time I was ſo tender that I could<pb facs="tcp:52451:6"/>not but interrupt you by my Friend. Oh! <hi>John,</hi> how hath thy Pride and Itch to be a Teacher of Allegorical Myſteries, Tranſported thee to be accounted a profound Doctor.

The Phariſees made void the Scriptures by their Traditions; Thou, and thy Brethren by your Light within, not vouchſafing to call it the Rule, but denying it ſo to be, as <hi>Pen</hi> in his late Writing. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees placed much of their Religion in outward things, waſhing of hands, &amp;c.

Thou art miſtaken in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this to me, through the Grace of God I have a little of that Unleavened Sincerity, and wait for more from Chriſt, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of himſelf and others: <hi>We can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.8.

The Light in every Man to be Chriſt, that we are juſtifyed by inherent Righteouſneſs, that Chriſt hath not now a Manhood, &amp;c.</hi> I account them groſs damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errors. Now errors were always rotten, never ſound, to give this Epithet to error, would be a Contradiction. Moreover, who ſees not but this is ſpoke in a moral ſence? I ſpake of Moral-Rottenneſs, not Natural Rottenneſs, not of the Rottenneſs of Wood and Apples, but of Doctrine, Rotten Doctrine was always ſo. That Opinion that was Morally evil was ever ſo. I ask when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Men of corrupt minds which were the falſe Apoſtles, muſt it neceſſarily follow that their minds were once ſound? When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>v. 20. Let no corrupt Communication, &amp;c.</hi> Was that Communication once ſound? It will as well follow that when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy</hi> of ſound words; that therefore they were once Rotten.

            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52451:10"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> How wide art thou in applying this of the Phariſees; the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did think Chriſt was a ſinner, we Believe he is the Holy and juſt One, a Lamb without ſpot, harmleſs and undefiled, ſuch an High-Prieſt became us to have: They did not Believe that Chriſt was God, therefore would not give the Glory to him; We Believe according to the Scriptures that <hi>he is and was over all, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. and therefore we give the Glory of all his works, and of this work of his upon the young Mans heart; in opening the Eyes of his mind to ſee the glorious Goſpel, and diſcern your deluſion, who was in his firſt Birth Spiritually-blind. Thou and thy Brethren are worſe than the Phariſees, they acknowledged matter of fact, but you deny this young Mans Eyes to have been opened; when-as the moſt inlightened Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt whoſe ſame is in all the Churches of the Saints have owned it, as an eminent work of the Spirit, giving thanks to Chriſt for it. J. C. <hi>pag. 5.</hi> Again thy words: <hi>None of thoſe that went out from you, were properly of you, had Received the Goſpel which you Believe. No, it is not poſſible for any to receive it truely, and forſake it. What that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is, which you Believe, it concerns you to ſearch, that it be not another Goſpel,</hi> Gal. 16. <hi>than the Apoſtles Preached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth highly concern us, I grant, for we are ſaved by the Goſpel. Therefore we have ſearched the Scripture which you deſpiſe, and ſay, is not the Rule. Where do you ſearch for the Goſpel? You enquire of the Light within, as of the Oracle. Therefore that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which we Believe, is not another, but the ſame with that which the Apoſtles Preached. We are <hi>Built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Chriſt himſelf</hi> (not the Light within) <hi>being the chief Corner-Stone,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20. The Goſpel which we Believe, is that Good, Ancient, Everlaſting-Goſpel, which was revealed to <hi>Adam</hi> fallen; and in vain was that Revelation, if the Light within would have ſhewn it, <hi>viz. The ſeed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents bead.</hi> The Light within cannot be ſaid to be the <hi>Seed of the Woman.</hi> When the Woman that is not to Prophecy in the Church, according to your interpretation, is the Carnal part, but it is Chriſt that in the <hi>fulneſs of time was made of a Woman, Gal.</hi> 4. Again it is that Goſpel that was Preached to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, viz. In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations (viz.)</hi> Jews as well as Gentiles) <hi>of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> Which Seed the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle ſaith, is Chriſt's Perſon. This Goſpel is witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets and the ſum of it is in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. <hi>ſeparate unto the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> v. 3. <hi>Concerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who was made of the Seed of David according to the Fleſh,</hi> (This is more than
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52451:10"/>to appear in a Body according to <hi>J Bolton's</hi> Faith) <hi>and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of Holineſs by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Dead,</hi> in Cor. 1.15. <hi>I declare unto you the Goſpel which I preached unto you,</hi> &amp;c. v. 3. <hi>how that Chriſt died for our Sins, according to the Scriptures,</hi> v. 4. <hi>And that he was Buried, and that he roſe again the third day according to the Scriptures.</hi> This is the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> and we confeſſing with the mouth this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Believing with our hearts that God hath raiſed him from the dead, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.7. <hi>For he was delivered</hi> (i. e.) to death) <hi>for our offences,</hi> and <hi>was raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for our juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25.</p>
            <p>J. C. <hi>For there were thoſe that perverted the true Goſpel, and turned it upſide down, and wreſted their ſayings to their own deſtruction; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers departed from the Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>Exhorts</hi> Timothy <hi>to hold faſt,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's very true, there were ſuch in the Apoſtles times, and they were thoſe that made themſelves equal to the Apoſtles, they transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> was but Carnal, walked after the Fleſh: and do not you pretend to an infallible Spirit, equal to the Apoſtolical Spirit? And have not you cryed down all ſorts of Miniſters beſides your ſelves? Now what was that perverting the true Goſpel in the <hi>Galatians</hi> but joyning ſomething to Chriſt in Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> Circumciſion, whereby they would make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one a debtor to the whole Law, that they muſt keep it to perfection: which whether it be not the ſame thing that thou art pleading for, ſhall be tryed as we go on. Only herein theſe falſe Apoſtles were not ſo much to be blamed as you; we read not that they deſerted the perſon of Chriſt, but you have run up and down the Nation with this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Light in every Man was Chriſt, from that Text, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>This was the Light, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>J. C. That others departed from that Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>Exhorts</hi> Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>to hold faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now, <hi>John,</hi> what is <hi>Paul's</hi> Exhortation to Thee? When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thy Brother <hi>Bayly</hi> pag. 35. in a deriſion ſaith, <hi>the Scripture which you call your Rule, is not your Rule, what matters it what Faith you are Exhorted to thereby, why do you thus make uſe of it?</hi> But let us ſee what Faith it was that theſe departed from, in I <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. See that <hi>v.</hi> 20. mention is made of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> Now in the 2 Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, Chap.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> is named again, and his Error particularly mentioned, ſaying, the Reſurrection is paſt already, v. 18. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> was for an Allegorical Reſurrection within, and now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52451:11"/>how often have I heard this, that when I have ſpoke with your Friends concerning the Reſurrection of the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> That they witneſſed the Reſurrection. They are for an Allegorical Reſurrection. This old muſty Error of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> we all know you be guilty of. Thou hadſt better not named that Scripture. Thou goeſt on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>J.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Goſpel is the Power of God to Salvation: Chriſt who is the ſum and ſubſtance of the Goſpel, as coming of the Seed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> according to the Fleſh, was declared to be the Son of God with Power, by the Reſurrection from the dead. So it is the Power of God, his power exerted in Chriſt's Reſurrection whereby we have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>He roſe again for our juſtification.</hi> Again, the power of God was greatly exerted in working Miracles, while they preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God bearing them witneſs with Signs and Wonders, with divers Miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> While you pretend to a New Goſpel, you ſhould have brought the Power of God to Seal it in Miracles. When he calls it the Power of God, it may be you underſtand it as <hi>Winkfield</hi> did, <hi>that God's Eſſential Power is Communicated,</hi> which cannot be; for then would the Creature to whom it's Communicated be omnipotent. And if thou would'ſt plainly ſpeak out, doſt thou not think that the Light that every Man hath, is part of the eſſential Power of God which is able to ſave every one that doth obey it? Now <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not a word of the Light that is in every one here: he ſpeaks of his readineſs to Preach the Goſpel to them at <hi>Rome,</hi> v. 15. which Goſpel what it was he had declared before, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>viz.</hi> a Doctrine concerning Chriſt's being Incarnate, and his Reſurrection: now he ſaith he is not aſhamed of this Doctrine; but thou and thy Brethren are, for you Preach it now: now the reaſon why he was not aſhamed of it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Power of God <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) The Spirit who is God made uſe of this Doctrine (that many deſpiſed) to the Salvation of many. The Spirit conveyed it ſelf into the hearts of the hearers by this Doctrine, and wrought Faith in them to receive it. Therefore that Scripture 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. doth explain the Preaching of the Croſs, <hi>i. e. Chriſt Crucified at</hi> Jeruſalem, without any Allegory, (not a word here of <hi>G. F's.</hi> Doctrine of a Light that every Man hath, to be turned to, which thou haſt been deluded by) <hi>is to them that periſh fooliſhneſs.</hi> I pray God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52451:11"/>it be not ſo to you,) <hi>but unto us which are ſaved it is the power of God.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 1.17. proceeds to tell us how this Doctrine, not the Law nor the Light, nor any other Doctrine, is that which the Spirit makes uſe of to convert, change, and ſave becauſe thereby the <hi>righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith.</hi> In the Doctrine of the Goſpel is revealed a Righteouſneſs that every way anſwers the holy Law of God which is the Righteouſneſs that God approves of. If I will be beloved of God, reconciled, have life, I muſt have a <hi>Righteouſneſs compleat</hi> to bring to God; now no Doctrine declares this but the Goſpel that declares the Remiſſion of ſins by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and that by the Obedience of this one we are made righteous; his Obedience without us. Now he faith, it is revealed from Faith to Faith, therefore Faith is not that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but receiveth it, being revealed. I have writ the more upon this Scripture becauſe it is greatly made uſe of by you. And ſome will ſee hereby, that it is not for you at all, but againſt you. Let me add this to what thou ſayeſt, <hi>that being led away by ſin is a departure from, or denial of the power.</hi> To whomſoever God gives Faith in this Righteouſneſs, he ſanctifieth inwardly, and whoever hath this Faith he hath it in a pure Conſcience; and who-ever makes ſhipwrack of a good Conſcience as to morals, it's a Token to us that he hath made ſhipwrack of Faith likewiſe, if he continue ſo without Repentance. This departing &amp; denying of the Power begins in unbelief, an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God, <hi>Heb</hi> 3.11. The laſt Scripture thou bringeſt in is 2 Pet. 3.17. <hi>where the Apoſtle exhorts the beloved, that knew the truth, to beware left they alſo ſhould be led away by the error of the wicked.</hi> Now <hi>John</hi> what error is there ſcarce mentioned in the Scripture which thou and thy people are not guilty of? In the late Scripture thou nameſt thou didſt plainly read thy ſelf in <hi>Hymeneus.</hi> Now again what errour of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this verſ. 3. <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers,</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>ſaying, Where is the promiſe of his coming? for ſince the Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. This was the error, viz. <hi>They did not believe the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</hi> Now in the face of how many thouſands have the <hi>Quakers</hi> denyed this? ſpeak of his coming again, they anſwer he is come, they witneſs his coming: Tell them of that Scripture in remembrance of him till he come; why Chriſt is come, therefore the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is antedated as to them. Thus they are for an Allegorical coming the ſecond time <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to the Spirit, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heed to the Light; and ſo it is without ſin unto Salvation according to you. Take heed leſt your Salvation prove only Allegorical not real. I have ſeveral times heard it, &amp; can name one not long ſince of the <hi>Quakers</hi> of <hi>Hartford,</hi> that hath ſpoke it, That we that look for the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But I am confident this young man was honeſt, and ſo true to his perſwaſion, for honeſty without the Faith of the Goſpel is their perſwaſion and Religion. Now thou reflecteſt upon us by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>then what they are converted from or to,</hi> &amp;c? I anſwer, we are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from darkneſs, that imbred natural darkneſs that we are in, and all men, unto <hi>Light,</hi> which Light is Chriſt's perſon and the Goſpel which declares of him, and ſo to all things that Chriſt in the Goſpel requires of us, which is not only Morality, but attending upon his Inſtitutions as the Lord's Supper. <hi>As often as ye do it,</hi> &amp;c, and through Grace we are true to this perſwaſion that the Holy Ghoſt hath wrought in us. You will give us leave to walk by our own Light, not yours, and to profeſs ſtill that we are not perfect nor think we ſhall ever attain it in this Life. Yet do we think that as the Carnal Jew. went beyond the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52451:12"/>Gentile; ſo if we were as you think us to be but carnal goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers; yet in that we are come further than the Quakers, that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make the people only moral Heathens.</p>
            <p>J. C. <hi>Thou ſayſt the little time he hath had for proficiency in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Goſpel might diſcourage thee from making his Book Publick. To which thou replyeſt, I wonder at it, ſeeing thou ſayſt before, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for any to receive it truly and forſake it, which if he hath not done thou ſpeakeſt unadviſedly with thy lips, in ſaying that it is an experience which the Lord in rich mercy gave him whom thou alſo calleſt dear and elect Child, and ſayeſt, fleſh and blood hath not revealed this to him but our Father which is in Heaven: but how can he that thus contradicteth himſelf agree with the truth in others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> So according to thy Reaſoning and Logick. It is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any to have been but a little time in the Goſpel and yet truly to receive it, as to be out of danger to forſake it. Is this is a Contradiction? every one that receives the Goſpel truly, muſt have received it many years, but if any turn <hi>Quaker,</hi> as <hi>Mede, Pen,</hi> and <hi>Ruddier,</hi> you will ſay they are in the truth the firſt day. As to the others, Cannot the Lord in rich mercy give an experience, and yet there may have been but little proficiency in the Knowledg of the Goſpel; that one may have the true teachings of the Spirit, and yet not fit to Write and Print? Is it not plain to all but Cavillers that I ſpeak it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That he having penned theſe in his own Words and Phraſes who was but newly come into the Faith, and ſo might have but a dim ſight into ſome truths, and not know how to expreſs himſelf ſo fitly as others that had ſpent more years in the Faith: why didſt thou not add that which goes before, <hi>viz.</hi> the meanneſs of the perſons Education? thou ſhouldeſt have taken them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

Therefore <hi>John,</hi> thou doſt but Juggle in thy words, like the Men on the <hi>Thames,</hi> Roweth one way, and looks ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pretends to the Lords Chriſt, and it is nothing but the Light within every Man. By this you may know what he means by his Teſtimony to Jeſus in the latter end of his Book.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That Chriſt that delivered <hi>Paul</hi> from the guilt of Sin and Puniſhment, while Sin dwelt in him, was <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> not the <hi>Quakers Chriſt,</hi> the Light within every Man, which according to Far the younger forgives Sin.</p>
            <p>J. C. page ibid. <hi>And if thou hadſt underſtood what thou ſaidſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before concerning the Blood of Chriſt, which thou calleſt Oyl poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gaſhes of Conſcience, thou wouldeſt not have ſpoken thus ſlightingly

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Through Grace I underſtand what I ſay, in that expreſſion, and have experienced it in mine own Soul. I underſtand by the Blood of Chriſt all the Sufferings of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> the Meſſiah, and the Merit, Virtue, and Value of them. (I do not with <hi>Quaker Penington</hi> underſtand the Heavenly Blood, in oppoſition to that Blood of his Earthly Body that was ſhed) <hi>Penington</hi> in his Queſtions page the 25th, ſaith, <hi>can outward Blood cleanſe the Conſcience?</hi> in thy confeſſion upon this Article, I Queſtion not but thou art of the ſame mind, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blood and Sufferings of Chriſt are all of no value for the taking away of Guilt, notwithſtanding all thy glorying words there. This Blood and Sufferings, the value of them towards God for the expiation of the Guilt of Sin, I apply to my own Soul that is guilty of the breach of the Law, and have peace hereby, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith we have peace with God;</hi> (are Reconciled, and ſo muſt needs have Peace of Conſcience) <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As for my ſpeaking <hi>ſlightingly if not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſphemouſly of the Quakers Chriſt,</hi> I am throughly perſwaded by my reading and converſe, without the leaſt deſire in my heart to wrong them; (Nay this laſt Teſtimony of <hi>Fox</hi> the younger, is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee if thou haſt been deluded by them) That the Light in every one is the <hi>Quakers</hi> Chriſt, and that they believe, there is no Manhood of Chriſt now, but it vaniſhed when Chriſt aſcended, and diffuſed it ſelf into every one. Now if thou art of the ſame mind, but will not pull of the Monks hood: Why ſhould you charge me with Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for ſaying that the taſters of Chriſt's Grace cannot take up with this Chriſt: is this the Sealed One? <hi>Him that was ordained as Peter</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ſet forth, Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>to be a Propitiation, the Head of the Church, the High Prieſt at God's right hand, the firſt-born of every Creature, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers Glory, the Eternal Word that was made Fleſh, the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>in which all the Nations of the Earth ſhall be Bleſſed, that Lamb of God that took away the Sins of the World, Judge of quick and dead, the only Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the Alpha and Omega, all in all.</hi> Therefore hear me <hi>John</hi> (that it thou beleiveſt as theſe have expreſſed themſelves) I charge thee with the higheſt Blaſphemies imaginable, and if thou do it knowingly and wittingly ſuch as never ſhall be forgiven; if thou attribute any of theſe Titles to any thing that is in Man, beſides the very Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52451:18"/>true Chriſt? Nay, but Man and ſelf inſtead of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs; for the Goſpel is a Myſterie, and the Preaching of it Fooliſhneſs to all that Periſh, and the things of it are the heavenly things themſelves, ſearched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Had I ſaid that with fleſhly ſtudy and Preaching from the ſame, we ſhould advance the true Chriſt, I had ſpoke like a vain Man; but thou haſt foyſted that in, apprehending that all the ſtudy and pains that we take in ſearching the Holy Scripture, is fleſhly and carnal, and Mr. <hi>Faldo's Key</hi> will open this to us, that all the enquiries after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is accounted by you but the Toyle, Labour, and Birth of the Fleſh. I perceive thou art not at all for ſearching into the Scriptures, and comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual, only for waiting upon the Light within you, as your Teacher, and Rule, and Guide. Couldeſt thou perſwade all the Miniſters to ſilence, <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> might carry your Kingdom of Deluſion the better. The Goſpel is a Myſterie thou ſayeſt, but <hi>John,</hi> it is a Myſterie revealed, it was hid in God, and none knew it but himſelf. If a Myſterie, we had more need to Study and ſearch out for it in the Scriptures. The Angels ſtoop down to pry into this Myſterie and to learn it now revealed, and yet thou wouldeſt not have us to ſtudy it. O vain Man! But what doſt thou mean by the Goſpel being a Myſterie? Is it ſuch a Myſterie as cannot be underſtood by Mans ſearching the Scriptures, through the enlightnings of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit? But the Key helps me again: It is a Myſterie becauſe it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Allegorie, and <hi>J. C.</hi> thinks that Allegoriſm is only the true Preaching of it; as once I heard thee make uſe of that paſſage ſpoke by the Angels to <hi>Mary:</hi> viz, <hi>He is not here, he is riſen,</hi> intimating ſo much, we are not to Look by Faith to his Death, but to the Light Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in our hearts: Thus it is a Myſterie, as in your ſence. That Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou mentioneſt from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was the Preaching of Chriſt Crucified, &amp; that was counted Fooliſhneſs, looking for Life to come by the death of another. <hi>Per mortem alterius ſtultum eſt ſperare ſalutem.</hi> Thus do the Jews, Heathens, Socinians, Quakers. What, that death 1600 years ſince, as far off thee, as <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> This is thy Language, the Heavenly things themſelves which thou mentioneſt are the things of the Goſpel, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23. It's true; but I am jealous that thou meaneſt the Light within by theſe Heavenly things themſelves, whereas it is plainly in oppoſition to the Veſſels, Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52451:18"/>Law, that were ſprinkled with Blood: thou muſt underſtand either Chriſt himſelf, who in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 10. was conſecrated through ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or the Church and People of God, who are the Heavenly <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> or Heaven it ſelf, whereinto he is entred with his Blood: The things of the Goſpel are things ſearched out by the Spirit, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they are already ſearched out by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God, Chriſt Crucified,</hi> which he ſpeaks of before, the things of this Doctrine, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>but we have the mind of Chriſt;</hi> they are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles, and by the Wiſdom &amp; Judgment of Man enlightned by the ſame Spirit that gave them forth, we may attain the Knowledge of them, and not without; but this Spirit thou ſpeaks of is nothing but the Light that every Man hath according to the Quakers; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, we cannot be perſwaded by thee, to that deep ſilence thou intimates in caſe we did look for ſuch an effuſion of the Spirit, as was at firſt, knowing that the Apoſtles themſelves at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> waiting for the Promiſe of the Father, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. <hi>continued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication.</hi> I ſuppoſe it was not mental Prayer in a ſilent meeting; but we believe by an ordinary Revelation of the Spirit upon our minds, in the diligent reading of the Scripture, we may be able to underſtand the Myſteries neceſſary for Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.18. <hi>The Spiritual Man diſcerneth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J. C. <hi>Thou ſayeſt we are to conceive of God, according as the Scripture ſets him forth to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou mighteſt well have joyned that to this which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goeth before it, <hi>viz.</hi> we are prone to meaſure God by the Rules of our own imagination, and to think that what appears to be Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with us, is ſo with him: but this would have prevented thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Cavil. I inſert it leſt the Reader ſhould not have the Epiſtle by him, I ask now, Whether the Scriptures or our imaginations and thoughts be the Rule whereby we are to meaſure God and true Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</p>
            <p>J. C. <hi>pag.</hi> 16. <hi>But the Scriptures contrariwiſe Condemn all Mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings, ſaying, Eye hath not ſeen, Ear hath not heard, it hath not entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of Man to conceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When I ſay; We, it's plain I underſtand Saints and Miniſters that have the Spirit, not thoſe that are totally deſtitute thereof. For I write to a <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> direct my Speech to them, and by way of digreſſion to my Brethren in the Miniſtery. And though thou appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeſt none but Quakers and their Miniſters have the Spirit, give me
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52451:19"/>leave to think that others have, and theſe to whom my Epiſtle is ſent, ſo that thou doſt but here trifle as in other places, and very Childiſhly; the Scripture doth no where condemn Man's conceivings of Godly the Scriptures and according to them.</p>
            <p>The Scripture thou mentioneſt here ſpeaks of the natural Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. oppoſed to the Spiritual <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Man that hath no more Light than that which every Man hath. Why art thou angry with this, <hi>John?</hi> if any do conceive of God according to the Scripture he conceives aright of God, and it argues he hath the Spirit: But I know where it pincheth thee, thou wouldeſt not that any ſhould conceive of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture, but according to the immediate teachings of the Light within. I know <hi>John,</hi> thou art an Enemy to the Scripture, as ſhall appear as we go on.</p>
            <p>J. C. <hi>ibid. The Scriptures are true, as God means them; not as Man by his conceivings interprets them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If thou wouldeſt ſpeak out, thou wouldeſt ſay that this God that only gives the meaning of the Scriptures is the Light within, ſo that according to thee, none can give any true meanings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but <hi>John C.</hi> and thoſe Brethren of his in the Minſtery: Thou art herein as bad as <hi>Muggleton</hi> the Prophet, he ſaith none can interpret Scripture aright but he. Thus <hi>John,</hi> thou haſt ſet up a few Popes at <hi>Devonſhire-Houſe,</hi> from whom, as from ſo many Oracles, we are to receive the true Interpretation of Scriptures; it's true, what thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt here: But doth not the Spirit who is God, give the meanings of the Scriptures in the Scriptures? Do not they Interpret themſelves beſt? When thou ſayeſt as <hi>viz.</hi> Man by his conceivings: Why, are not the Saints Men? And the Miniſters of Chriſt Men? Ours are ſtill, though yours be Women and Virgins.</p>
            <p>But <hi>J. C.</hi> how didſt thou forget thy ſelf in contradicting the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>G. F.</hi> who ſaid, that the Man in the Male, and the Man in the Female may ſpeak, and ſo Interpret Scriptures in your Meetings, and here thou ſayeſt, Not as Man by his conceivings Interprets them.</p>
            <p>J. C. <hi>And the underſtanding of every true Diſciple muſt be opened by Chriſt, before he can rightly know them, as it is written,</hi> he opened their Underſtandings that they might Underſtand the Scriptures: <hi>for till then they are a ſealed Book to the Learned and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This likewiſe we acknowledg to be true, but then do ſtill query, Whether this Light that openeth the Underſtanding of every true Diſciple be not the Light within that every one hath? if not, then the Light within cannot do it, thou granteſt, and that Scripture thou na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52451:19"/>confirms me, that thou haſt forſaken thy Principle, about the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of the Light within; for in the laſt of <hi>Luke,</hi> that opening of the Diſciples Underſtandings ſurely was another thing, than any teachings of the Light that every one hath. It was ſome Beamings of the Spirit at that time, enlightning their Underſtandings, which are of a different nature from that Light that every one hath, as in time we will make evident. I grant in the cloſe, that the Scriptures are a ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book both to the Learned, and Unlearned, that have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, according to <hi>Jer.</hi> 55.21.11, 12. Only, I query whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill it be not a ſealed Book to all but the Quakers? Thou goeſt on to the next Paragraph of the Epiſtle and meddles not with a word of this more, ſo that I take it for granted; and let the Reader take notice of it, that <hi>J. C.</hi> conſents either to this firſt Principle, in the <hi>Series</hi> of the Principles, as in order they are laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch is the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God that nothing is accepted by him, but what is every way compleat and perfect; and if ſo, then he believes that Righteouſneſs within, which conſiſts in the vertues and gifts of the Spirit, in every Quaker is every way perfect and compleat, and for this compleatneſs is accepted, and that it will hold the teſt before God's Tribunal, and ſo will juſtify us, and that it is beyond the Righteouſneſs of the Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: or he doth not conſent to it; if ſo, then he is afraid to touch it, but ſilently paſſeth it, as a Principle that is altogether too ſtrong for him to encounter, though it's the <hi>baſis</hi> of all the reſt touching Imputed Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>J. C. <hi>pag.</hi> ibid. <hi>Thou uttereſt many words about the Confeſſion of Sin, as if the Quakers were againſt the Confeſſion of ſin to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to this Head or Principle that is alſo aſſerted, thou doſt not ſpeak any thing, <hi>viz.</hi> None of the Sons of Men ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, (that was no more than Man) hath ever brought, neither can any of them bring this perfect and compleat Righteouſneſs to God: either thou conſenteſt to this or no; if thou doſt, as by thy ſilence it ſhould appear, then what becomes of the Quakers Perfection that thou and all have pleaded for? It is then a Perfection that is not a compleat Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: if thou doſt not think this true, thou playeſt the Hypocrite in not contradicting it, but if thou would not juggle and play Leger-de main thou doſt think that Man can bring a compleat perfect Righteouſneſs ſince the fall, and this Righteouſneſs is in every Quaker wrought by the Light and it doth juſtifie; of which afterwards.</p>

            <p>Pag. ibid. <hi>Yet we ſay (now this is ſpoke from an infallible oracle) in

But we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52451:21"/>now will declare our ſound Scripture-ſenſe as followeth: Chriſt is our Advocate with the Father, and his Blood; the infinite worth of it, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of all his ſufferings ſpeaks to the Father <hi>John</hi> 1.2. he is an Advocate by vertue of his being a Propitiation, as there its ſpoken; now he was not a propitiation within us, therefore he is not an Advocate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; that is the Spirits work, enabling us to go to God in prayer through his Name, yet we ſay that faith that looks to this, and truſts to this, is wrought within us by the Spirit, and ſo know that the blood ſpeaks the ſufferings without; and thus we have peace of Conſcience.</p>

Who of us ever denyed that we were to have a real Righteouſneſs in Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but this is not to juſtifie us: we make a difference between Chriſt's perſonal Righteouſneſs and our Sanctification; the one imputed to us, the other wrought in us: we had by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> not only guilt of Sin, but the loſs of the image, and the power of indwelling ſin: ſo we have two Righteouſneſſes by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; the one to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the guilt of ſin, that is the Righteouſneſs I am pleading for, and the other to take away the reigning power of ſin, Sanctifiying of us, and renewing of us into the image of Chriſt in ſome degree; but this latter Righteouſneſs is but an effect of the other. Chriſt is not only the Author of the former (that we are ſpeaking of, as he is of all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) but the ſubject of it.</p>

What then is the matter: Becauſe I cannot ſay that the Righteouſneſs the Spirit works in us, is the ſame but different from the Righteouſneſs that was perſonally wrought out by Chriſt when here on Earth, in that I think one far excels the other: the ſum is, becauſe I ſay that all the Righteouſneſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> can attain to by attendance to the Light within, will not juſtifie them, without the perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, which they deſpiſe.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52451:33"/>would have them to do to us, is the Righteouſneſs that Juſtifies before the Glorious Tribunal of an infinite pure God, whoſe eyes are as a flame of Fire, that thou dareſt ſtand and fall to the ſtrict judgment of God, as thou haſt all thy days (for curſed is he that continues not in all things to do them) been true or falſe to this Principle? I trow not; wo to thee then, for thou haſt in ſeveral things in this thy writing dealt with me, as thou wouldeſt not have me to deal with thee; why but then, if it be not that which Juſtifieth, it is better never be found at all, in doing to any as we would have others ſhould do to us, for this is but our Moral Righteouſneſs, in the ſecond Table commanded between Man and Man: how doſt thou like this retortion?

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52451:47"/>himſelf that called <hi>Cyrus</hi> to this great work; if then you would prove ſilent Meetings from this Scripture, as thou ſayeſt thou canſt, then it muſt run thus, and this is the moſt genuine, ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prophet here calls the Dumb Idols, that had Mouths and ſpake not, and Ears and heard not, and Feet and walked not, to gather themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and keep a ſilent Meeting; and there God would be known to them, they ſhould turn to the Light, and become Quakers.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture for ſilent Meetings, is <hi>Jam.</hi> 25.2. <hi>Zachary</hi> 13. <hi>Be ſilent O all Fleſh before the Lord,</hi> ſuch another is that which is joyned to this, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The Lord is in his Holy Temple, let all the Earth know ſilence before him.</hi> Now, let us try if from hence all Fleſh, and all the Earth ſhould keep a ſilent Meeting: who ſeeth not but theſe two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with that third that this Man nameth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God, &amp;c.</hi> do ſpeak forth thus much? <hi>viz.</hi> That ſeeing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had been Enemies all along to God's people, and had wronged and diſtreſſed them, now God was eminently coming forth to Judg them, and deal with them, and therefore ſpeaks thus to them of ſilence, foreſeeing how it would be with them all, as with them that are ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and aſtoniſhed with the ſence of their own guilt and weakneſs, and God's Greatneſs and Righteouſneſs; therefore, we read in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. of Deſolations in the Earth, of Wars, and how God is the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it follows, <hi>I will be exalted among the Heathen, I will be exalted in the Earth: W.

This Man was aſtoniſhed at his own Guilt, and God's wrath that was due: I do think in this ſence, there will be the greateſt ſilent Meeting that ever was, at the day of Judgment, when every Unbelievers mouth ſhall be ſtopped; but yet as no means of ſavingly knowing God. But <hi>Revel,</hi> 8.1. which is brought next, will do it effectually, all theſe have failed. <hi>There was ſilence in Heaven,</hi> it follows, <hi>about the ſpace of half an hour;</hi> now <hi>Baily,</hi> why didſt thou omit this laſt paſſage, whereby thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as well have known how long your ſilent Meetings ſhould continue not above half an hour; But let us enquire the genuine ſence of this place, likewiſe, is there any more in it than this? <hi>viz.</hi> that for ſome ſmall ſpace of time comparatively to the time of trouble, the Church ſhould have a time of freedom from perſecution! this brings to mind that your ſilent Meetings have been of great uſe to you in theſe late per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions.

               <p n="4">4. If the Heathens could by all the Light they had, attain to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then their Converſion was not ſuch a Myſtery, but it's ſpoke of as a very great Myſtery, wherein God's Rich Grace and Power was ſeen to a wonder, as the Scripture bears Witneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Opinion that makes void that Prophecy ſpoke of, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.32. viz. <hi>That Chriſt ſhould be a Light to Lighten the Gentiles,</hi> cannot be true; but this of the Quakers doth: <hi>Ergo.</hi> For if they had ſufficient Light before, there was no need of the other.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the Heathens notwithſtanding all the Light within, which is ſpoke of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. yet were at that ſame time unrighteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>and under Sin, and fallen ſhort of the Glory of God, v.</hi> 23. <hi>unjuſtified,</hi> then this is true, that the Light they had, was not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Light; but ſo it is: <hi>Ergo.</hi> You cannot ſay they were not obedient to it, for they did things contained in the Law.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That Opinion that makes Divine Revelation to be in ſome, is falſe; but this doth, to ſay, that the Light that every Man hath is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Light: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if Salvation can be attained by attendance to this Light, then it's in vain, for God to make known his will and mind and way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by the Revelation of the Scriptures. <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura, and fieri poteſt per pauciora.</hi> In vain doth any, that by more, which may be done by fewer things and ways.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If the Light within can reveal Chriſt ſavingly, then was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> no Covenant of Grace, it was not Grace to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for God to make known his Will to him, when-as he might have attained it by the Light he had before, and which others might have known as well as he.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If all the Light that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall, was not ſufficient to preſerve him to Salvation, and prevent his fall, much leſs is that Light in Man being fallen ſufficient to reſtore him, and ſo ſave him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If Angels could have known the Goſpel without Revelation, then this Light is not ſufficient to Reveal him ſavingly, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels could not, as appears by the Scripture, in that it was a Myſtery, hid in God, and they learned it of the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That which makes the omnipotent Work of God, upon the heart of Man, by ſavingly enlightning his Mind and Underſtanding, giving a new Heart, taking away the Heart of ſtone, making him a new Creature <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in vain, is not to be admitted as true; but this doth, to ſay every Man hath a ſaving Light.</p>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> The Saviour Chriſt is in us by his Spirit, but yet neither is the whole perſon of Chriſt in us, for he is Man as well as God: this Union doth not confound our Perſon and his Perſon, nor our Actions and his, but they are diſtinct; neither is this In-dwelling and Union the Righteouſneſs that Juſtifieth us; we eat and drink his Fleſh and Blood by Faith, ſo have the benefit of his Obedience, Sufferings, and Death, the Spirit cauſing us to truſt to the Merit of them as Sinners: but yet the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt is not in us, unleſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> will turn <hi>Carpocrations,</hi> that aſſerted that they did really eat the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Bodily carnal Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt; or Papiſts, that aſſert the very Fleſh, Blood, and Bones of Chriſt are turned into the Bread, or rather the Bread into the Body of Chriſt. Yet the <hi>Quakers</hi> have aſſerted this, that the Man Chriſt is within us, meaning nothing but the Light within, but of this before. Thou intimates thus much here <hi>Baily,</hi> that the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt is nothing elſe but the Light that is in every carnal wicked Man.</p>

                  <p>If ye ask me what it is? I Anſwer, ſome Principles of Common Truth, fixed in the Mind of Man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What can it effect? How far can it go?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this, Man may know ſome Divine things: <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a God; and that he is to be Worſhipped: Therefore, every Nation have had ſome kind of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereby Man may diſcern betwixt ſome Moral Good, and Evil. As the Heathens ſaw hereby Murther and Adultery to be Evils; and therefore made Laws to puniſh thoſe that were guilty of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Man may hereby, and by the help of Conſcience and the Common Reſtraining Power of God, be kept from many Evils; and do many Duties that lie before him, for the profit of his Neighbour, for the good of the Society or Common-Wealth wherein he dwells: for this one thing he ſeeth by it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Judgment of God <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Juſtice to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin; and this makes him fear.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From this Light, is that power in Man, which he feels, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and excuſing. He may know many things to be good, and his duty to do them; now, when he doth according to this knowledg of his, reflecting upon it, he hath Peace; his Conſcience will be quiet: if not, there will be trouble through the many reaſonings that will be in Man; and fear of Judgment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Light is greatly helped and increaſed by the conſideration of the Works of Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. More by the reading of the Scriptures, hearing the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, converſe with Chriſtians. And let it be noted, that the Quakers had the Improvement of the Light, this way, though they will not acknowledg it. In <hi>India,</hi> we hear but of little Improvement of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Many that live not up to this Light, will be very inexcuſably Condemned.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And thoſe that walk according to it, doing ſome things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law, do ſhame, Judg and Condemn thoſe that pretend to Chriſtianity, and yet live not in Righteouſneſs and Sobriety. <hi>And ſhall not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, which is by Nature, if it fulfil the Law, Judg thee, who by the Letter and Circumciſion, doſt tranſgreſs the Law,</hi> Rom. 2. 27.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What can it not ſhew to Man?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It cannot ſhew to Man, how ſin came into the world. None of the Heathens ever ſpoke of this, it is known only by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Hiſtory of it, in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth not ſhew to Man, neither can it, that the firſt motions to evil in the heart, (though not conſented to,) are ſin. None of the Philoſophers ſaw this: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known Luſt (i. e.)</hi> Concupiſcence, Deſire; (to be ſin, he means;) <hi>except the Law</hi> (That is, <hi>Moſes</hi> Moral Law) <hi>had ſaid, thou ſhalt not Covet,</hi> or deſire: He knew it not by all the Light of Nature within.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It doth not ſhew Unbelief to be a ſin: a ſlighting and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rejecting Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as the ſealed Mediator, <hi>John</hi> 14.8. <hi>He (i. e.)</hi> the Comforter, <hi>ſhall convince the World of ſin, becauſe they believe not.</hi> Now this is plain in the Quakers; who following the Light, do ſo much contemn the Perſon of Jeſus; and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſhews not to Man, ſome Moral Evils. The Heathens ſaw not Fornication to be a Sin, by all the Light they had: <hi>Poligamy</hi> was not accounted a ſin by them: Nor Revenge a Sin: Nor Vain Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It doth not ſhew the right way of Worſhip, that is by Scripture-Revelation only: Therefore the Heathens always ran into Idolatries and falſe Worſhips.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It will not ſhew to Man, the neceſſity of the New-Birth. Every Man while in his Natural State, knoweth not hingof this: It is a Riddle as it was to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that had more than the Light within, the Light of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Myſtery of the Redemption of Man from the Fall, by the Sacrifice of Chriſt; It's utterly ignorant of it, cannot ſee any thing of it; nor ſhew it to Man. But this ſeems fooliſhneſs to Man, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of being ſaved by the Croſs of Chriſt. It was ſo to the Greeks; and is ſo to the Quakers at this day. None of the Heathens therefore ſpoke any thing of Redemption by Chriſt; if they did, they had it from <hi>Moſes</hi> Writings, and the Prophets. No, theſe things are too high: 1. That very God, ſhould become very Man. 2. That a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſhould bring forth. 3. That by giving up that Body that he took into Union with himſelf, unto Death, he ſhould make Atonement to God's Juſtice; and expiate for all the ſins of all thoſe that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him. Theſe, Man that hath no more than the Common Light, cannot, will not receive.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52451:63"/> 8. The Reſurrection of the ſame Body, is a thing that this Light will not diſcover. It is only the Scripture-Revelation. The Heathens knew nothing of this; but it was a ſcorn to them; Jeſus, and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And the Quakers, attending to the Light within more than the Scriptures, do err as to this Truth and gain ſay it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It cannot ſhew, That the Soul of a Saint is immediately with Chriſt upon the departure from the Body: nor indeed, any thing of a future ſtate. This muſt be known by Scripture-Revelation: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Life and Immortality was brought to Light through the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a Light that every Man hath not, but is peculiar to the Saints: Thoſe that are born again, and converted from their fallen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition; and put into another ſtate, through Chriſt Jeſus. This we have proved before, from the Scriptures; only will add thus much, <hi>viz. God ſuffered all Nations,</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>to walk in their own waies,</hi> Acts 14.16. but had at that time a people, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the midſt of the Nations; Of whom he ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. <hi>He ſhewed his Word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael: <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; and as for his Judgments they have not known them.</hi> Here it's plain, he gave Light and Knowledg to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſuffered others to walk in their Natural blindneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Light is at the ſame time in a Saint, with the other, that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſaving Light.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Light is a true Light, as to it's kind and Nature; as far as it will reach.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But that this Light that every Man hath, and that we ſpeak of which every one hath not, are two different Lights, as to kind and Nature; and not only as to Degree; as the Quakers would have it; I prove as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Roots from whence theſe two Lights do ſpring be different, then the Lights differ in Kind and Nature: But the former is true, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt as a Creator, is the Root and Fountain of this, that every one hath; but Chriſt as Mediator, is the Root of the Light that the Saints have. I prove that the Light that every Man hath, is from Chriſt only, as Creator.</p>
                  <p>If whatever <hi>Adam</hi> had in his State of Innocency, was only from Chriſt as Creator; not as Mediator: Then this Light that every Man hath, is only from thence: But the former is true, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:52451:64"/>
                  <p> If the Light that every Man hath, be only a remnant of that ſame Light that <hi>Adam</hi> had in Innocency; Then the conſequence will hold; But it is only a remnant, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be nothing but Nature, then the <hi>Minor</hi> of the laſt Syllogiſm is true: <hi>viz.</hi> that it is nothing but a remnant of the Light that <hi>Adam</hi> had in Innocency: But it's no more than Nature; which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 2. If the Light that every one hath, differ only in Degree, and not in Kind from the Spirit of Regeneration; then the moſt wicked ungodly perſon may be ſaid to be truly Gracious, and Sanctified, and Regenerated; though not in ſuch a high Degree as a Godly one. For the ſmalleſt Wire of good Gold, is as truly Gold as the whole Wedg, though not ſo much: Water hot in the ſecond or third Degree, is as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hot, as that which is hot in the ſixth or eighth Degree. He that is ſtrong in a leſs Degree, is as truly ſtrong, as he that is in a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: But what a ridiculous thing is it, to ſay, that the moſt wicked Man is a true Believer; a true Saint? When-as he is ſo far from this, that he is not truely Moral and Civil?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they differ only in Degree, then a Regenerate Man and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, differ no more from one another, than a Babe in Chriſt, and one ſtrong in Chriſt; — But to ſay this is falſe, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If having the Light within, be conſiſtent with all manner of Wickedneſs, and continuing in it to the end; but the having of the other Light is not: Then they ſurely, differ in Nature and Kind: But the former is true: as all ſee and know daily. Many that have the Light within, which the Quakers ſpeak of, are Wicked, Ungodly, and continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>to the end. None that have the Spirit of Regeneration, are ſo, and continue ſo: They may fall into ſin, but do not continue in it; nor make a Trade of it. <hi>He that is born of God cannot ſin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If a Man may have the Light within which the Quakers ſpeak of, and yet be dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes; but not the other, but muſt needs be ſpiritually alive; in that it is the Principle of Spiritual Life; then they differ in kind. But the former is true: For every one had the Light within: the Quakers grant; But every one is not Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alive; but moſt dead in ſins and Treſpaſſes: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. If thoſe that have the Light within (which the Quakers ſpeak of,) may go to Hell with it: and the damned in Hell have it ſtill in them; then they differ more than in Degree. But the former is true: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what is that which accuſeth in Hell, and condemneth in Hell?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52451:64"/>Anſwer. But now to ſay, that any part of the Spirit of Regeneration, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, goeth to Hell; and is in the Damned, would be ridiculous, if not Blaſphemous; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. If Fleſh and Spirit differ more than in Degree, then theſe two Lights do: But ſurely, Fleſh and Spirit differ more than in Degree; <hi>Ergo.</hi> All the Light that every Man has, as he comes into the World, is but Fleſh: <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>Whatſoever is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh.</hi> Now Fleſh and Spirit are ſo far from being of the ſame kind, that they are contrary one to another; and luſteth one againſt another.</p>

All the ſins of all the Elect were virtually purged, or cleanſed then: A price laid down to expiate them all, by the Sacrifice of Chriſt. This was ſixteen hundred years ſince. The drinking of the Blood, is but the Application of it in time. Then is it manifeſt that it was done for ſuch. But ſtill thou confounds Juſtification and Sanctification. We are not forgiven our ſins by reaſon of any works wrought in us; No, theſe works in us, are but effects of forgiveneſs: But by the vertue and worth of the work and ſufferings of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us. And whereas thou askeſt, Whether the Blood be not within, if it be drunk? So I ask thee, If any eat the Fleſh of Chriſt, is it not within him? If Chriſt dwells in our hearts by Faith, is not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt in our very hearts? and ſo the Man Chriſt? Now by the Blood, who underſtands any thing, but all the Sufferings and Death of Chriſt; his offering up himſelf as a Sacrifice? Can theſe be drunk but

Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements muſt be taken away; and there is nothing will do it, but the Sufferings and Blood of Chriſt. Now the guilt of ſin is taken away, by God's Act of not imputing ſin to us, upon Faith: Which Faith is wrought in us by his Spirit; in that Chriſt <hi>was made ſin for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. As for the power of ſin, this is broke in us, by the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Sanctification; which begins in Faith on Chriſt. Now as this work is carried on in the Soul, ſo the preſence of ſin is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. But it's the will of God, that the work of Sanctification ſhould not be ſo abſolutely perfect in this Life: So that Sin hath ſome preſence in the beſt of Saints; yet no condemnation to them, becauſe they are in Chriſt.

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Yea, it did, and it doth now; and nothing elſe. It was not the Light within. Many had this, the Jews had it, the Fathers of theſe he is writing to; yet they walked in vain Converſation <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in error and ſuperſtitions, after Traditions; as he there ſpeaks. And ſo multitudes of Heathens at this day, and many in this Nation. But whoever Chriſt hath died for, ſhall effectually be called from ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The offering up of himſelf was the Meritorious cauſe of all Holineſs. Whoever then walk in the vain Converſation of error, falſe Worſhips, Superſtitions, Wickedneſſes, to the end; manifeſt, Chriſt never dyed for them. They were not Redeemed, nor bought with his precious Blood.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt <hi>Parag.</hi> of the 43. <hi>pag.</hi> thou ſpeakeſt of <hi>the Indwelling of Chriſt in his people by his Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. <hi>I will dwell in them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And of his preſence in the Goſpel-Churches; walking in the midſt of his Golden Candleſticks.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Both theſe ſurely, are conſiſtent with Chriſt's being a perſon without; and all his ſuffering without; Theſe all are but Fruits of Chriſt's dying for his Church. But before I leave this, one Scripture in <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. thou haſt, <hi>viz. By Mercy and Truth Iniquity is purged.</hi> What meaneſt thou by this? I am afraid thou art a down-right Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. The Papiſts ſay, that by Alms-giving, Iniquity is taken away; Doſt thou think ſo? For that is <hi>Mercy.</hi> So, by doing to others as we would be done by, is ſin pardoned, for this is <hi>Truth,</hi> and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Speak out, Is there any thing that Man can do, (which thou doſt here imply:) that can take away his iniquity? Is this the Blood that thou owned'ſt before? Then may many unclean Drunkards have their iniquities purged; yet remain ſo. For ſeveral of them, (it's known;) are merciful to the Poor, and true in their Words and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and Righteous in their Trades. Surely then, it is more ſafe to underſtand this Scripture, of the <hi>Mercy and Truth of God;</hi> his <hi>Mercy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing forgiveneſs through Chriſt, and his <hi>Truth,</hi> in making this promiſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52451:71"/>good. Thus is Iniquity Forgiven, Redeemed, Covered. In the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> it is, <hi>in Mercy, and in Truth, is iniquity redeemed, or covered.</hi>

Much of <hi>pag.</hi> 44. is the very ſame that he ſaid before of me, and of the young Man: he ſends ſome ſhot in Railing, in <hi>Parag.</hi> 2. and breaks forth into the Praiſes of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and <hi>Thraſo</hi>-like boaſts in his confidence. And thus goeth on, threatning all but themſelves, as <hi>Babylon and Antichriſt.</hi> At length, concludes <hi>pag.</hi> 45. in the 4th. <hi>Parag.</hi> in Prayer: He begins thus, <hi>viz.

                  <p>Before we come to examine the inſtances, let me but Query, How this people came to be thus called? Was it not upon their ſtrange fits of bodily Tremblings, which they had in their firſt Riſe, wherein all their fleſh and bones would tremble? I take it for granted, having ſpoke with ſome that have ſeen them thrown upon the ground in this poſture. Now that ſuch bodily Tremblings as theſe are eſſential to Chriſtians, and to the people of God as ſuch, I deny; they never had ſuch, except it was upon ſome dreadful Viſions or Appearances, as you in the leaſt can by no claim to. This is no part of Chriſtianity. Though we do not cenſure the Quakers as no Chriſtians, becauſe they trembled thus: but becauſe they deny Chriſt himſelf, from whom that Name is derived; and the Chriſtian Doctrine. So that your Religion, is a Religion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind and ſort and <hi>Species;</hi> much more like <hi>Mahumetaniſm,</hi> or <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or Heathen-Philoſophy, than Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Now to the Scriptures, which prove the people of God of old, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
                  <p>Iſa. 66. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Such as tremble at my Word.</hi> This is the firſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Was this bodily Trembling here ſpoke of? Is there not in the ſame <hi>verſe</hi> a contrite Spirit mentioned? Was it not in Spirit, having a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awe and Child-like fear of the threatnings of God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moſes <hi>was a Leading Quaker,</hi> Heb. 12. This may be ſpoken of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſome think, not as if it were verified in his own Perſon, as if he did quake; but he is brought in as the Mouth of the people, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Name of the people; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the Name of all the people: he being a Mediator betwixt God and them.

Was your Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Mountains in the <hi>North,</hi> delivered with that Auguſtneſs as the Law at Mount-<hi>Sinai?</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap> Chriſtianity? Nay, it only argued this, that he was imperfect; a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, legal in part.

                  <p>The next is <hi>Ezekiel, He was a Quaker;</hi> in Chap. 12.17, 18. <hi>The word of the Lord came to me, ſaying, Son of Man, eat thy Bread, with Quaking, and drink thy water with trembling.</hi>

                  <p>As for <hi>Pauls trembling,</hi> prove it ſuch <hi>Bodily trembling</hi> as yours. We deny it, and ſay it was not ſuch.</p>
                  <p>That in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. was not <hi>Bodily Trembling;</hi> but an holy fear and reverence of God, in their Spirits rouſing them from ſecurity upon conſideration of the Decrees of God.</p>

I find my Spirit (and rejoyce at it,) growing in this Tenderneſs every day, more and more to loath Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ſtench, and rottenneſs; not only in Mens lives, but in their Judgments.</p>

                  <p>As for my <hi>Rebelling againſt the Light</hi> thou mentioneſt, I can ſay, in a great meaſure I followed and obeyed it, when a Child, and a Youth, But knew a time when I had a better guide beſtowed upon me. I have now that Light in me walks not contrary to it. But it is not my Guide nor Rule. But the Spirit of Chriſt leads me to the Holy Scriptures, as the Rule.

                  <p>After a Repetition of ſeveral of my ſayings, in <hi>pag.</hi> 27. of my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Book,</hi> I find thee <hi>W.

                  <p>According to this Rule of thine, might I ſay of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25. That the Covenant of Grace was no more than giving <hi>Abraham</hi> a Son in his old-Age: And <hi>Hagar</hi> the Bond-Woman, which bare <hi>Abraham</hi> a Son, is the very <hi>Mount Sindi</hi> in <hi>Arabia;</hi> on which God gave the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo I might ſay from <hi>Luke</hi> 18.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That God is unrighteous; and that he will not hear his People unleſs they trouble and urge him with their Cry. Which God forbid I ſhould ſay or think. I know no more wickedneſs in ſetting forth working for Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by <hi>Iſrael's</hi> being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> than for the Scripture to ſet forth God, by an <hi>unjuſt Judg.</hi> Is this abuſing my <hi>Similitude</hi> in this manner, a Fruit of the pure Light within?</p>
                  <p>But why may not my Condition in obeying the Light within, be compared to a <hi>ſtate of Bondage?</hi> Seeing this Light teacheth the things contained in the <hi>Law;</hi> though not all things contained in the Law as they ought to be taught. As not to <hi>kill,</hi> not to <hi>Steal;</hi> not to <hi>Commit Adultery,</hi> and many more: and ſaith in this Language, <hi>viz. Do this
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52451:79"/>and Live:</hi> Which is plainly the Covenant of Works. This Light teacheth <hi>That the Man that keepeth his Statutes,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>the Commandements of the Light, he ſhall live in them. As in</hi> Levit. 18.5. Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> The <hi>Quakers</hi> words are theſe, <hi>viz. Mind the Light, heed, obey the Light and turn to the Light which reproveth;</hi> and ſuch-like expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Which words are good in their place; but when Juſtification, Life and Peace with God, are placed herein, they are ſtark naught. For then the Goſpel, and the Honour and Glory of Chriſt are deſtroyed. That Chriſt which <hi>was dead, and is alive, and liveth for ever,</hi> Revel. 1.18. Which cannot be the Godhead without the Manhood. So then, he that ſubmitteth to the Light and obeyeth it, doth not <hi>Steal,</hi> as he that heeded the Covenant of Works. And this Light as that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhuts up people unto Good works, only to do them for fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. So that, they that are thus obeying the Light, differ not from <hi>thoſe that all their Life-time were ſubject to Bondage by reaſon of the fear of Death,</hi> Heb. 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> calls it no other than <hi>Bondage,</hi> to be under the <hi>Law</hi> for Life and Salvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.25. Why therefore may not I compare it to ſuch an Eſtate; without ſuch Wickedneſs as you ſpeak of? How often do you ſay there muſt be a cleanſing from all ſin in this Life; elſe no Salvation? Doth not this ſpeak, that the Righteouſneſs in which Man is to live, muſt juſtify him? Is this any other than the Covenant of Works, which is perfectly to be kept, or no Salvation to thoſe that are under it? Where is Goſpel-Repentance now? Where is a freedom of Will, and delight to do good? It is all out of doors. This I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, upon my own Spirit, when the Lord enlightned me to ſee Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; then came in a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of will to good: and a Delight and ſweetneſs in doing Good; which I had not before. Neither can this be in any, where this <hi>Change</hi> is not. There may be in you Quakers, a Legal Repentance; which is a turning from Wickedneſs to Civility; becauſe ye are bound ſo to do, for Life and Salvation, as you think. But Goſpel-Repentance, is an Obedience to the Faith which Juſtifieth without Works. And ſuch an one receiveth thankfully, and accepteth of the Righteouſneſs of (that Perſon,) Jeſus Chriſt, for his Juſtifying Righteouſneſs: And from thenceforth in Love to Jeſus, and for the honour of his Name, liveth ſoberly; as a Son obeyeth his Father; But doth not look to be made a Son, and owned to be a Son; and ſo accepted and received, by theſe works wrought in him, and by him. Which kind of Repentance, the Light within every Man, ſheweth not. So let him which hath the

It teacheth that the Law muſt be kept perfectly, or elſe thou canſt not be ſaved. Yet I ſtill deny, that every Man that cometh into the World, is Lighted with a Goſpel-Spiritual-Light. This is a Light that every Man hath not. Therefore in Anſwer to your <hi>Requeſt</hi> pag. 40. <hi>viz.</hi> to know of us, <hi>Whether there be a Light that every Man hath not? And if ſo, how it differs from the other?</hi> I ask, Can there be the Light of the Sun, without the Sun? Or the Light of the Fire, without the Fire? Or can there be the Light of a Candle, without a Candle? Then can there be the Light of the Spirit in Man, without the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Now it is Evident that all Men have not the Spirit, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his:</hi> Implying, that ſome were without the Spirit. <hi>Jude</hi> 19. <hi>Senſual, not having the Spirit.</hi> Gal. 3.2. <hi>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> Then there was a Time before they received it, ſeeing they might remember when and how they received it. <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>The Spirit of Truth which the World cannot receive:</hi> Then the World hath it not. And many more Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be gathered out of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> That both Jews and Gentiles had a Light, the Gentiles had <hi>the work of the Law written upon their hearts;</hi> and the Jews with this Natural Light, the Knowledg of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> Yet were without the Spirit, not being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the <hi>Faith of Jeſus,</hi> but oppoſing it. Wherefore, as a Man in outward things cannot lay hold on that which is beyond his reach; no more can any, by that common Light that every Man hath, lay hold on that which is above its reach. For that Light that ſhewed <hi>Adam</hi> that he had broke the Law of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. did not ſhew unto him the way of deliverance; but God ſhewed it to him by <hi>Revelation.</hi> So is it in our Day, none ſeeth any Beauty or Comelineſs in the Goſpel without the Lord reveal it unto him by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Now here comes in the other <hi>Query, pag.</hi> 41. <hi>Whether this Light I ſpeak of, the Light of the Spirit of Chriſt, be another ſort or kind of Light, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from that which every Man hath?</hi>

                  <p>But now, of thoſe that have the other, in the leaſt meaſure of it, this is ſaid, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Now the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart, and of a good Conſcience; and Faith unfeigned.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Holding Faith and a good Conſcience, which ſome having put away;</hi> But how did they put it away? What, by falling into Theft, Murder, and Adultery, and ſuch-like practiſes? Not ſo much by theſe things, if at all: for <hi>they became Teachers of the Law;</hi> and as I humbly conceive, thought that the Law muſt be kept perfectly, as neceſſary for Salvation; by which Doctrines they did corrupt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and caſt off the Faith which once they pretended to; making an <hi>unlawful uſe of the Law,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> Witneſſeth, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. whoſe <hi>Doctrine did eat as a Canker,</hi> as it doth in our day. Therefore the ſum of all is, as to theſe two Scriptures; No Faith in Jeſus, no good Conſcience, no pure Light. For they are always joyned together; never go aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. That he <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God at that preſent from his forefathers, (i. e.)</hi> as <hi>Abraham and Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. that were in the ſame Faith that he had now; only they looked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt to come; and he, as already come: <hi>With pure Conſcience,</hi> How ſo? had he not a pure Conſcience always? No, when-as he ſaid of himſelf before, when a Phariſee <hi>he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus:</hi> Yet lived ſtrictly, as touching the Law. But time was, that when a Phariſee, the Lord met him, and ſmote him to the Ground, and gave him his Spirit: and then he <hi>builded up the things that before he deſtroyed: viz.</hi> The Faith of Chriſt, and then, and not till then, had he a pure Conſcience, and ſerved God with this pure Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Obj. But why ſhould this Common Light be counted impure, or an evil Conſcience; ſeeing it reproveth for ſin? And the Heathens by this, did things contained in the Law, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their Conſciences bearing Witneſs? Why ſhould it be ſo called or ſtiled?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe, it doth not ſhew unto Man Obedience to the Will of God, from right ends, and from right principles; from right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding and judgment: But is like an unskilful <hi>Pilot,</hi> that undertakes to Steer the Ship, and yet runs it upon Rocks and Quick ſands. So this, teacheth the <hi>things contained in the Law,</hi> and yet deſtroyeth the Goſpel, miſſing of the way of Obedience out of Love
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52451:82"/>to God. There is no Doctrine under Heaven begetteth this Love to God, like the Doctrine of the forgiveneſs of all ſin in the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But is there then a difference betwixt this Light in every Man, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for ſin; and the Light of the Spirit, in their Teachings and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Light of the Spirit, eſteemeth, reckoneth, or prizeth the Perſonal-Obedience of Chriſt, 1600. years ago, <hi>viz.</hi> his keeping of the Law in every point. He having fulfilled the Law in our Nature, <hi>that knew no ſin</hi> of his own; as the <hi>only Righteouſneſs</hi> by which we are juſtified before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. And makes the Soul gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and imbrace it in all humbleneſs of Spirit, this Perſon, and his Perſonal-Obedience, as the greateſt Treaſure in Heaven and Earth and cauſeth the Soul in all thankfulneſs to walk in Obedience, before and to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But the Common Light, looks for a Righteouſneſs within, to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed by the Righteouſneſs in which Man liveth, and conſequently the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit begetteth an eſteem of the Sufferings of Chriſt, the Sacrifice of his Body, as the only means by which we are freed from the wrath of God due to our ſins, <hi>he being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Heb. 10.12, 13, 14. Iſa. 53.5. Gal. 3.13. But the Common-Light count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it a <hi>Doctrine tending to Looſneſs,</hi> as may be ſeen <hi>pag.</hi> 35. and 50. of the Book called <hi>Rebellion Rebuked.</hi> And I my ſelf did once ſo eſteem it, but now no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirit makes us eſteem the Croſs of Chriſt, and the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Perſon of Chriſt through it, and the penalty of the Law, and raiſing him to Life again; <hi>and exalting</hi> him into Glory, <hi>to be a Prince and a Saviour,</hi> Acts 5.31. to be the <hi>Power of God to Salvation</hi> to as many as thankfully receive it and embrace it.</p>
                  <p>But the Common-Light eſteemeth that power and dread in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which reſtraineth Man from ſin, binding Man to obey for Life and Salvation, to be the power of God to Salvation. And in many more things there is a difference, in their teachings and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nay, I ſcarce know one Goſpel-Truth, but this Common-Light contradicteth: yet the Teachers of this Light, come with the words
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52451:83"/>of this Glorious Goſpel. So that word is true, which hath comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me many a time; and may comfort others, <hi>viz. If it were poſſible the very Elect ſhould be deceived:</hi> But notwithſtanding all the ſubtilty of Satan, <hi>it's not poſſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But farther, the Spirit cauſeth a higher Repentance, than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Light. Such a Repentance, ſuch a Change in the Will, that the Saints even loath their own Bodies; they are as it were weary of them, becauſe of the Corruption that dwelleth in them, though the power of it be broken that it doth not Rule and Reign over them. Not becauſe they would be juſtifyed by a Righteouſneſs wherein they would live; as <hi>Paul</hi> Witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. But that they might glorify God more in their Generation; that they might be for the praiſe of his Name, that hath redeemed them.</p>
                  <p>But the Common-Light worketh a Change in the Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to merit Eternal Life by; and to get into the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. So that there is not ſo clear a Love, nor ſo free a Will to walk in the Commandements of the Lord, as is in the Goſpel-Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance wrought by the Spirit; As may plainly appear, by what <hi>VVilliam Baily</hi> ſaith, in the 35. <hi>pag.</hi> of his Book, <hi>viz. If ſo be the Father hath pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out all his wrath upon his Son, there is no need to fear miſcarriages.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>If ſo, the Devil may play what Cards he will.</hi> Now, whoever taſted of the Goſpel, that would make this uſe of it, but did count it as their only happineſs?</p>
                  <p>There is difference in the <hi>Motives</hi> and Arguments to move to a Holy Life, between theſe two Lights. My experience in this hath been as a ſecond <hi>Pillar,</hi> which the Lord hath made uſe of, to uphold my Spirit for ſome time. And comparing my experience with <hi>John</hi> 16.14, 15. I have been relieved; and perhaps it may be a relief to others, if with me now they view the three Diſtinctions in thoſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>He ſhall Glorify me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I conſidered, who that was that ſhould be <hi>glorified:</hi> Whom I conceive is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> born of the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> the Mediator or middle-Perſon betwixt God and Man; having the Nature of both, that he might accompliſh the work that he had to do; and that he might hear and defend his people, when they cry unto him, ſeeing <hi>he was touched with the feeling of our Infirmities,</hi> Heb. 4.15. But is now <hi>Exalted</hi> in the Heavens in that very Body which he took of the Virgin, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. This is he that was to be <hi>Glorified.</hi> For he doth not point them unto that within him or within every Man; but to his <hi>Perſon, v.</hi> 16. ſpeaking of his departing a little while after, ſignifying his Death, which <hi>filled them with ſorrow.</hi>

Who that was, that ſhould <hi>receive of his,</hi> which is plain; <hi>the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, whom</hi> he ſaid, <hi>he would ſend, v. 7.</hi> in his perſonal abſence. Whoſe office is, <hi>to take of Chriſt's things, and ſhew them to his people.</hi> For though the Spirit be the ſame in Eſſence, yet it hindereth not but they may be, &amp; are, two in Office and Perſonality. The Spirit thus taketh of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, Sufferings, <hi>the Travel of his Soul,</hi> to redeem his people, and <hi>ſheweth them unto his people.</hi>

Now Jeſus Chriſt being <hi>born of a Woman,</hi> was <hi>made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. who in all things did fulfil the Law in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and at all times, in all caſes and conditions: So that <hi>he knew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By which Obedience, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs of Chriſt, we <hi>are made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> Rom. 5.19. Therefore he is called by the Prophet, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6. <hi>A Saviour and a Deliverer.</hi> Now <hi>the Comforter taketh of theſe things and ſheweth them unto us;</hi> When we ſee our miſerable and wretched Condition, under the Wrath of God, and our inability to keep the Law of God. And this is the Language of the Spirit to us, <hi>viz. Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.4.</p>
                  <p>Now it is not the Office of the Spirit the Comforter; much leſs of the Light within every Man; (which deſerveth not the Name of the Comforter:) to work Righteouſneſs in us to juſtifie us; though it doth lead to Holineſs: Neither to bring us to fulfil the Law in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be juſtified thereby before God; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Though I once was entangled with an opinion of this Nature, <hi>viz. That it was Chriſt by the Spirit which wrought in me: therefore it was not my Righteouſneſs but his, and this for Juſtification.</hi> Jeſus was put to death, Crucified, <hi>cut off, not for himſelf, he was an Offering for ſin for ever,</hi> Heb. 10.12. <hi>A ſacrifice well pleaſing to God: And he roſe again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. Signifying ſo much, that he had ſatisfyed the Juſtice of God for the Sins of his people; and could not be held of Death. Now <hi>the Spirit taketh of theſe things,</hi> when Man is, (as we have ſaid before:) under the ſence of the wrath of God, and applyeth them unto his heart; giving him Faith herein, ſaying, <hi>Chriſt was made a Curſe for thee;</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in thy place, room, and ſtead.

Now the Spirit, as we ſaid, <hi>taketh of theſe things, and applyeth them to his people,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>he hath;</hi> (not he will redeem, but hath) <hi>Redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.13. and hath <hi>made them Sons through Faith,</hi> Gal. 4.6. though they had infirmities, and had need of <hi>Reproofs and Exhortations to good works;</hi> as may be ſeen in the <hi>Epiſtle;</hi> he <hi>having obtained everlaſting Redemption,</hi> through the means of his <hi>Death, entring into the Holy Place once, with his own Blood,</hi> Heb. 9.12, 15.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I ſay, doth the Spirit Preach to the Souls of poor Men; As an Ambaſſador receiveth of the King his mind, and declareth it is a far Country; ſo the Spirit receiveth of Chriſt's Love, his Riches Care for his people; and gives them to underſtand them, for themſelves for their own Comfort.</p>

                  <p> So then you ſee, it is not (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay;) <hi>Obey the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſubmit to the power thereof; that your peace may be made; that ye may get into the Love and favour of God; that you may be made the Sons of God, by the Righteouſneſs which the Light hath wrought in you;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that I have read, that <hi>George Fox</hi> the younger hath writ. Theſe are his words, <hi>viz. If ye would believe and wait in me, or obey me the Light in you, I will purge out all your iniquities, and forgive all your Treſpaſſes; and I will change your Natures, and make you New Creatures, if you will hearken to me, and obey me, the Light in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye ſee the Motive of one and of the other Light to Obedience, is different.</p>
                  <p>Again, another difference is, that the Light of the Spirit of Chriſt, layeth a Man more humble and low in his own Soul, than the Light the <hi>Quakers</hi> plead for. It ſheweth him, that he hath nothing to boaſt or glory in, but all is freely given him: Nay, if God ſhould deal in Juſtice with him, that he is a wicked perſon, in that he hath ſin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his fleſh, a corrupt nature; if God ſhould look upon him as in himſelf; this might juſtly befal him, to be condemned.</p>
                  <p>So that he cannot vaunt it over his Neighbour, and ſay, I am Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, thou art Wicked; I am good, thou art evil; I have done Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, thou haſt done Wickedneſs: and thou mayeſt be Righteous and hold on, and do good, if thou obey the Light in thy Conſcience, the voice of the Lord, calling unto thee in the inward parts (which thing the Quakers ſay by their Light) and I have ſaid it in heart many a time, before the Lord humbled me to accept of the perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, for my Juſtification as I am a poor ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Again, there are things which the Light of the Spirit diſcerneth to be ſin, which the Light in every Man cannot diſcern to be ſin. As Firſt, to ſeek for and look for Juſtification, Reconciliation, Acceptance with God, in, with, or by the Righteouſneſs in which we live, acted in our perſons: It ſeeth not this to be a Deſpiſing the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; a corrupting the Goſpel, eclipſing the Glroy of Chriſt a contradicting God in his Way and appointment for the Salvation of poor ſinners. It ſeeth no evil in this which yet makes Chriſt of no Advantage, <hi>not ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> Yet I am not ignorant my Adverſaries will ſay, <hi>They are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and they do not deſpiſe the Goſpel; with many more</hi> good words, as they have writ; which would to God were true.</p>

His foundation is ſure, yet as to us it is brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and very uncertain, conſidered in our ſelves, by reaſon of our Corruption that dwelleth in our Fleſh, and the many Enemies we have, within and without: carnal reaſon gets up, and it contendeth in our Breaſts, ſaying, what Fooliſhneſs is this, to truſt to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of another? What, muſt ye not be Righteous in your ſelves and can ye be Righteous elſe? and unbelief gets up, and ſaith, what, will ye believe that the promiſes of God are true? That ye are made Righteous by the Obedience of Chriſt? That he for you hath overcome Sin, Death and the Devil? how can this be; when ſin dwelleth in your Fleſh to this day, and the Law cometh with its Threatning, to bring trouble upon the Spirit? The <hi>Devil</hi> accuſing, and ſtirring up the Enemies of the Goſpel to lay falſe Notions, and errors, and ſtumbling-blocks in the way: and the half of our ſelves <hi>Warring</hi> againſt the other, <hi>The Fleſh againſt the Spirit;</hi> and ſo hinders the view and ſight of the Goſpel for a time: and our Faith is very weak and low.

Criſp,</hi> though I do not expect to be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, or to have my Peace made; or to get into the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, by theſe Good things wrought in me: But believe they are the Fruits of that juſtifying Love and Favour of God to us, through Faith in Chriſt, without the Deeds of the Law. So that if I be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Lier, a Thief, a Blaſphemer, a wicked Perſon; not fit to be believed in Words, or truſted in Actions;</hi> it is I ſay, a ſmall matter, it is no more than what was their Lot which went before. And the Scripture hears Witneſs to it, <hi>viz. That all manner of evil ſhall be ſpoken of the people of God falſly, for Chriſt's Names ſake:</hi> The ſame that comforted <hi>Paul,</hi> comforteth me; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. in this Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, I ſay it is a ſmall matter to be Judged by <hi>W. Baily,</hi> or 8. <hi>Criſp,</hi> or by a <hi>Jury of eleven.</hi> I call them a <hi>Jury,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Jury</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to their Evidence, not knowing the Perſon that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Fact. And ſuch were ſome of theſe. Yet I do not know that I have acted any thing contrary to that which God hath given me in my inward parts.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, as theſe things have been falſly declared concerning my Faith with what elſe ſoever; I have only this to ſay as my deſire. <hi>The Lord lay it not to their Charge but forgive them,</hi> and embrace then in the Arms of his Pitty and Compaſſion; Even ſo be it: <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Which I ſhall Anſwer by way of <hi>Querie,</hi> and leave it to others to Judg. Though it's poſſible, my Adverſaries may have five words for my one.
